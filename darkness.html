			<p> 1. Each page contains a puzzle for you to solve. The difficulty of the puzzle depends on the way you think.
				Don't worry, it's not that hard. </p>
			<p> 2. The answer to the puzzle will replace the part of the URL just before the .html. 
				Put .html after every answer, or you might end up somewhere even we don't know. </p>
			<p> 3. Try to have fun while solving the puzzles. Guessing wildly really doesn't help at all. Really, it doesn't.</p>
			<p> 4. This is an experimental website that tests the user's critical thinking, as well as technical thinking.</p> 
			<p id = "hint"> 5. Some answers are just hidden <strong> in plain sight.</strong></p>
			<p> 6. Don't worry, clues are always provide, you just have to know where to look. </p>
			<p> 7. Some outside knowledge *might* be needed. We don't really expect to know everything, you know.
				You can look for the answers elsewhere if you want to.</p>
